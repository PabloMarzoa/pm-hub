🚀 How to use the update dependencies script:

# 1. Basic usage

bash# Update specific components

npm run update:deps button modal datepicker

## With full names

npm run update:deps pmds-cdk-button pmds-cdk-modal

## With full names with prefix

npm run update:deps @pmhub/pmds-cdk-button

# 2. Script features:  

🔍 Automatic analysis:  

Scans the entire monorepo looking for package.json

Builds a complete dependency graph

Identifies circular dependencies

📦 Version management:

Automatically increments patch versions (20.0.4 → 20.0.5)

Cascade updates all affected dependencies

Maintains the correct update order

🎯 Use cases it solves:

You change a directive → The script updates:

The directive

All components that use it

The umbrella packages (pmds-cdk, pmds-core)

Change multiple components → Automatically calculates all dependencies

Complex dependencies → Resolves the entire graph without duplicates

# 3. Practical example:

If you modify the button component:

bashnpm run update:deps button

The script will do:

Find @pmhub/pmds-cdk-button

Increase its version: 20.0.1 → 20.0.2

Search for all components that depend on button

Update them one by one in the correct order

Finally, update pmds-cdk with the new version of button

# 4. Advanced features:

Smart name detection: You can use button, pmds-cdk-button, or the full name

Cycle prevention: Detects and handles circular dependencies

Detailed summary: Shows what was updated and why

Topological order: Updates dependencies before dependents
